# InTrack IMS - Starter Checklist

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
â˜‘ Finalize UI/UX design (mockups/wireframes). ðŸŽ¨
â˜‘ Set up the GitHub repository. ðŸ’»
â˜‘ Start coding with the updated stack! ðŸš€


## Project Overview
- Define core purpose: What is InTrack solving?
- Identify user roles (Admin, Staff, Customer)
- List MVP features and key workflows
- Write a short product vision/mission statement

## Design System & Branding
- Choose color scheme (primary, secondary, accent, background)
- Decide on fonts (heading + body)
- Define spacing and sizing rules
- Light/Dark mode toggle? Yes / No
- Design base UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards, modals)
- Document styles visually (Figma, PDF, or Notion)

## UI/UX Planning
- Sketch wireframes (can be rough or digital)
- Define navigation flow between pages
- List core pages/screens (e.g. Dashboard, Products, Orders, Login)
- Plan responsive behavior (desktop > mobile)

## Component Architecture
- Plan component structure: `/components`, `/layouts`, `/pages`
- List reusable components (Button, Modal, ProductCard, etc.)
- Use Tailwind for styling with consistent utility classes
- Set up layout components (e.g. Sidebar, Topbar)

## Developer Standards
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep files modular and focused
- Avoid repetition (DRY principle)
- Use `.env` for all sensitive variables
- Organize folder structure clearly

## Version Control (Git)
- Initialize Git repo
- Use proper branch naming: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `refactor/`
- Commit often with meaningful messages
- Push to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket

## Development Best Practices
- Write dummy/mock data to simulate real use
- Keep logic out of UI components when possible
- Split API logic into separate `/lib/api/` or `/services/` folder
- Validate inputs, handle errors gracefully

## Documentation
- Add project setup guide (`README.md`)
- Include database schema (can be visual)
- Document key logic and component behavior
- Note third-party services used (Supabase, Firebase, etc.)

## Feedback & Iteration
- Set up deployment (e.g. Vercel for preview)
- Test MVP flow with friends or team
- Keep a changelog or progress log

## Final Checklist Before Coding
- Tech stack is installed and tested locally
- MVP features are clearly written down
- Designs/wireframes are done
- Component plan is mapped
- Ready to build ðŸ”¥

**Let's go. Start with structure, stay consistent, and build with clarity.**
